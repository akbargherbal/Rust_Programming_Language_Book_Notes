1) 	Rust interface is all functions [fn].
		a)	At least we need one function which is the main function.
		b)	an example of a function will be:
				fn main() {

				}
2) 	The concept of borrowing / references / ownership is central to Rust.
3)	The concept of slices ... especially String slices.
4) 	It goes without saying Rust is a statically-typed language.
